## Bitcoin and Lightning payments in Coinsnap Paywall ##

The Coinsnap Paywall allows you to accept Bitcoin for exclusive content and clearly differentiate your offer from the competition.

This is how you create added value – both for yourself and for the growing target group of Bitcoin customers!

With the Coinsnap Bitcoin Lightning payment processing plugin you can immediately accept Bitcoin Lightning payments on your site. You don’t need your own Lightning node or any other technical requirements if you'd like to provide payments via Coinsnap payment gateway.

Simply register on [Coinsnap](https://app.coinsnap.io/register), enter your own Lightning address and install the Coinsnap payment module in your Wordpress backend. Add your store ID and your API key which you’ll find in your Coinsnap account, and your customers can pay you with Bitcoin Lightning right away!

If you want to use another BTCPay server as Payment provider, you need to know your store ID, your API key and gateway URL as required parameters.


## Features ##

* **All you need is your email and a Lightning Wallet with a Lightning address. [Here you can find an overview of suitable Lightning Wallets](https://coinsnap.io/en/lightning-wallet-with-lightning-address/)**

* **Accept Bitcoin and Lightning payments** in your online store **without running your own technical infrastructure.** You do not need your own server, nor do you need to run your own Lightning Node.

    * No basic fee, no transaction fee, only 1% on the invoice amount with referrer code.
    * Without referrer code the fee is 1.25%.
    * Get a referrer code from our [partners](https://coinsnap.io/en/partner/) and customers and save 0.25% fee.

* Set your price!
* Select the currency in which the price is to be displayed

![Configure your paywall shortcode](https://resources.coinsnap.org/products/paywall/images/screenshot-7.png)

Now you can copy the shortcode at the bottom and use it in your content.

### 5. Prepare restricted content ###

5.1. Create content

Now create content as usual in your WordPress, for example a text as in this example. As soon as you have finished the article, you must place the shortcode you have just produced at the point where you expect your reader to pay. You usually do this after the introductory paragraph.

**Tip:**
If you want to place a paywall before the download of a video, create a short description of the video content as an introduction and place an image of the start screen of the video next to it. This way, your users can see what to expect and why they want to pay for the video!

5.2. Save your post or page and find paywall widget by its URL.

### 6. Test payment ###

Go to the test payment page by copied URL. Click on payment button and go to the payment page. 

![Test payment](https://resources.coinsnap.org/products/paywall/images/screenshot-11.png)

This payment page shows your customer the amount payable in SATS. Click on “view Details” for further information. 

Then you see the QR code. Hold your wallet above it and the amount of SATS displayed above will be transferred from your wallet to the Coinsnap wallet as soon as you click the button “pay”.
